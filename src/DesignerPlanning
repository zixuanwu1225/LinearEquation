Variables
- should include x and y values for both coords
- should have variables for scanners that ask for two coord points
-slope
-y intercept
-distance between two points
-allow x value as scanner part and use to form y value on the line given by the prev equations already. (Print as coords)
Notes -
If coordinate points are given, use DecimalFormat to make coords rounded to nearest hundredth.
